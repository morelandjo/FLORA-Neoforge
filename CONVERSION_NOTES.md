  - Ender Pulse (teleportation)

#### 8. **Resources** ‚úÖ

### What Still Needs to Be Done

#### 1. **Textures** ‚ö†Ô∏è
You need to add textures for:

**GUI:**
- `assets/flora/textures/gui/infuser.png` (176x256 PNG)
  - Main GUI: 176x166
  - Tank overlay at y=180: 112x10

**Fluids:**

- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/pyrotheum_flowing.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/cryotheum_still.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/cryotheum_flowing.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/mana_still.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/mana_flowing.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/ender_still.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/ender_flowing.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/redstone_still.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/redstone_flowing.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/glowstone_still.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/fluid/glowstone_flowing.png`

**Armor Textures:**

- `assets/flora/textures/armor/leadstone_1.png` (layer 2 - leggings)
- `assets/flora/textures/armor/hardened.png`

- `assets/flora/textures/armor/redstone.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/armor/redstone_1.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/armor/resonant.png`
- `assets/flora/textures/armor/resonant_1.png`

**Items/Blocks:**
- Item models for all buckets, armor pieces, and infuser
- Block model and blockstate for infuser

**Entity Rendering:**
- Textures for pulse entities (optional, can use default rendering)

#### 2. **Data Generation** ‚ö†Ô∏è
Recommended to add DataGen for:
- Block states and models
- Item models
- Recipes (if you want craftable armor)
- Loot tables
- Tags

#### 3. **Crafting Recipes** üí≠
The original mod had recipes using Redstone Arsenal and Thermal Expansion items (commented out).
You'll need to decide:
- Make armor craftable with vanilla/modded items
- Make it creative-only
- Add your own progression system

#### 4. **Optional Enhancements** üí≠
- Add JEI/EMI integration for infuser
- Add Patchouli documentation
- Create custom particle effects for pulses
- Add sound effects
- Add fluid interactions with world (like Pyrotheum setting things on fire)

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Build the mod successfully
- [ ] Load into game without crashes
- [ ] Armor pieces appear in creative tab
- [ ] Fluid buckets work correctly
- [ ] Infuser block can be placed
- [ ] Infuser GUI opens
- [ ] Armor can be placed in infuser
- [ ] Fluids can be added to armor
- [ ] Armor effects activate when wearing filled armor
- [ ] Pulse entities spawn and work correctly
- [ ] All 7 fluids are obtainable

### Key Differences from Original

1. **No Thermal Foundation dependency** - We created our own fluids
2. **No Redstone Arsenal dependency** - Recipes removed (need replacement)
3. **No crafting recipes** - Need to be recreated
4. **Modern NeoForge APIs** - Using DataComponents instead of NBT directly
5. **Simplified proxy system** - Using event bus subscriptions

### How to Build

```bash
cd "D:\MinecraftMods\Returns Mods\FLORA-Neoforge"
gradlew build
```

The mod jar will be in `build/libs/`
